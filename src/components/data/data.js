By using useState I've made it possible for the users to navigate through each post by simply clicking the left or right arrows on the page. The useState ensures that the post's index value is memorized and it renders the new content upon swapping to a different index value.",

It gave me a wonderful opportunity to work with generating a gallery of cards that are dynamically created using extracted information from the API. This task also gave me ample opportunity to create a functional search bar and a toggle on and off filter system. Which was a very fun, challenging and exciting experience for me.",

This was a entertaning and fun project to work with as well as being challenging. I made my todo list simple in it's design, it's a todo list so it doesn't need to be fancy. I added the ability for the user to submit their task by either clicking the submit button or by pressing their ENTER key.",
